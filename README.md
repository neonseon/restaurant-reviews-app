# Restaurant Reviews App

A responsive progressive app that meets accessibility standards for screen readers and utilizes page caching to create a seamless offline experience for users.

## How to Run the Application

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace my Mapbox API key entered in `mapboxToken` with your own token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

The app consists of a home page that displays a map of all the restaurant locations and a way to filter by neighborhood and/or cuisine. When the user selects a restaurant, they are taken to the restaurant detail page with more information on restaurant address, hours and reviews.

Most of the HTML is generated by JavaScript and pulled from JSON.

## Contributing

This project was created for the FEND Udacity course. Therefore, I will not accept pull requests. Should you decide to clone, most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
